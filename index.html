		<p class=paragraph>As somebody who has always loved solving problems, when I did my first case competition in tenth grade, I instantly became obsessed with exploring business problems and that eventually drove me to pursue a Business degree. In university, I continue to compete in case competitions and joined the Laurier Consulting Club to learn more about consulting and help other students who want to pursue a career in consulting.</p>

		<p class ="text2">For AIESEC in Laurier, I led a team to cold-contact and run sales meetings with businesses in the Waterloo region to pitch our internship program (bringing international interns to their team). In doing so, I also trained my team to manage our account using Salesforce. I managed the relationships with our key stakeholders: the companies and the interns. I remember how nervous I was in tenth grade before every cold call, but I am proud of how I used that experience to become better in future roles.</p>

		<p class="text4">I have always loved going to new places, even if it is just somewhere in my city that I have never been to (especially new restauarants) . After my first year of university, I flew to Beijing, a city I had never visited, to complete an internship with only my suitcase to accompany me. I learned so much during this experience and it gave me a newfound appreciation for independent travelling. </p>

		<img src ="images/musicDrawing.png" style ="float:left; width:35vw;">
		<p class ="text3">I began playing piano when I was really young and over the years have picked up a mix of other instruments. Interestingly, I think my love for music relates to my passion for programming, as learning the basics of each tool allows me to craft a variety of different things. My favourite way to de-stress is learning to play a new song and concerts are some of my favourite events to attend.</p>
